# Lodash Learning Tests

## Libs:
- [ ] Nodejs
- [ ] Lodash
## Libs:
- [ ] lodash | @types/lodash -D (https://lodash.com/)
- [ ] babel-plugin-lodash -D

## Run
- [ ] yarn
- [ ] yarn dev

## Usage of learning test
- [ ] Access route: http://localhost:3333/test (get)

## Modify files and test for yourself

## Why Lodash?
Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
Manipulating & testing values
Creating composite functions

## Why Use a express route for test?
The idea is test several lodash functions for with arrays to return json.
Something like a backend/frontend needs to do.
